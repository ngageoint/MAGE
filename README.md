# MAGE

MAGE is a dynamic, secure, mobile situational awareness and field data collection platform that supports low-bandwidth and disconnected users.  MAGE can integrate with existing command centers and common operating pictures or stand alone as a complete, mission-ready solution.
The MAGE mobile app on iOS and Android allows agents in the field to create and share geo-tagged observations with attached photos, videos, audio, and form data.  MAGE's data collection forms are easily tailored to suit any team and mission with custom form fields and map symbologies.  In addition to data collection, the MAGE mobile app can optionally report field agents' locations at regular intervals to the MAGE server.  The MAGE server's web app provides a common operating picture of field agents' observations and latest reported locations.
